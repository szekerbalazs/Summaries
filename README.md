In this repository, you can find all my summaries that I created throughout my studies at ETH. In each folder, you can also find the .tex code if the summary was written in LaTeX.

Feel free to use them at will. If you find the summaries useful, you can [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/szekerbalazs). â˜•
